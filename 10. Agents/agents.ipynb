It is located in the southern portion of the province of Ontario, at the confluence of the Ottawa River and the Rideau River. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver . Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. With a recorded population of 2,794,356 in 2021, [10] it is the fourth-most populous city in North America.

Enjoy affordable, family-friendly junior men's hockey games at TD Place Arena at Lansdowne, in the lively downtown Glebe neighbourhood. Ottawa on the other hand, has a population of about 1 million, which makes it a much smaller city than Toronto. It's the capital of Canada, and while it is multicultural as well, it has more of the feel of what is stereotypically seen as Canadian - smaller, slower paced, colder weather and bilingualism.
