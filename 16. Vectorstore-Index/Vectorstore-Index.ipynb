    "2. 文本分割（Splitting）：文本分割器把 Documents 切分为指定大小的分割，分割后的文本称为“文档块”或者“文档片”。（本次忽略）\n",
    "3. 向量存储（Vector Storage）：将上一步中分割好的“文档块”以“嵌入”（Embedding）的形式存储到向量数据库（Vector DB）中，形成一个个的“嵌入片”。\n",
    "4. 检索（Retrieval）：应用程序从存储中检索分割后的文档（例如通过比较余弦相似度，找到与输入问题类似的嵌入片）。\n",
    "5. 构建QA链 (Chain)：组装 LLM 和 Retriever\n",
    "6. 输出（Output）：把问题和相似的嵌入片（文本形式）都放到提示传递给 Chain，让大语言模型生成答案。"
